# Contributing

Feel free to lay hands on everything you want (license allows for that any way \*wink\*). 
That means I'm open to any issues, pull requests, translations or other ways you want to extend, fix or enhance any of the features.

Just try to follow the style guide and any best practices but remember as a hobby and one man project I have the last say on anything that gets added to the project. Things I think are out of the scope of what the app is supposed to do will most likely not get approved, in this case feel free to fork this and make your own stuff (again, license).

## Style guide

I try to follow the [Node.js Style Guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide) by [Felix Geisend√∂rfer](https://felixge.de/) as closely as possible.
