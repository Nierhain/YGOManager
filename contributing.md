# Contributing

Feel free to lay hands on everything you want (license allows for that anyway \*wink\*). 
That means I'm open to any issues, pull requests, translations or other ways you want to extend, fix or enhance any of the features.

Just try to follow any best practices, but remember as a hobby and one man project I have the last word on anything that gets added to the project. Things I deem out of the scope for the app will most likely not get approved, in this case feel free to fork this and make your own stuff (again, license).
